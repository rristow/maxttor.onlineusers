maxttor.sessioncontrol
===================

Plone product to restrict the number of sessions of an user. 
The goal is to avoid that too many person use the same user-id. 
(It was developed for one plone instance and won't work properly with Zeo)

This product was based on "ityou.sessionscontrol", many thanks to http://www.ityou.de.
